## 1. Background and Motivation
<p align = "justify"> 
The motivation for this project is to uncover patterns and correlations that can provide insights into what factors make a movie successful in terms of its box office revenue. This is done by using Python and a variety of libraries to perform data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
The libraries used in this project include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. NumPy and Pandas are used for data manipulation and organization, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization. These libraries allow the notebook to create clear and informative graphs and charts that help to illustrate the relationships between different variables.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
Throughout the jupyter notebook, various questions are explored and answered using data analysis techniques. For example, the notebook investigates whether there is a correlation between a movie's budget and its box office revenue. It also examines whether movies released during certain times of the year tend to perform better than others.

Overall, this project provides an exploration of the relationship between different variables related to movies. Through its use of Python and various libraries, it offers a compelling example of how data analysis can be used to uncover patterns and insights in complex datasets.
