## 1. Background and Motivation
<p align = "justify"> 
The motivation for this project is to uncover patterns and correlations that can provide insights into what factors make a movie successful in terms of its box office revenue. This is done by using Python and a variety of libraries to perform data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
The libraries used in this project include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. NumPy and Pandas are used for data manipulation and organization, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization. These libraries allow the notebook to create clear and informative graphs and charts that help to illustrate the relationships between different variables.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
Throughout the jupyter notebook, various questions are explored and answered using data analysis techniques. For example, the notebook investigates whether there is a correlation between a movie's budget and its box office revenue. It also examines whether movies released during certain times of the year tend to perform better than others.

Overall, this project provides an exploration of the relationship between different variables related to movies. Through its use of Python and various libraries, it offers a compelling example of how data analysis can be used to uncover patterns and insights in complex datasets.

## 2. Dataset Retrieval

The dataset used in the project is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
<p align = "justify"> 
contains information about movies, such as the title, director, cast, genre, and rating. The dataset contains 7512 rows and 15 columns, with each row representing a different movie.
</p>

Here's a breakdown of the columns in this dataset:
1. **name:** The title of the movie
2. **rating:** The rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)
3. **genre:** The main genre of the movie
4. **year released:** The date the movie was released (YYYY-MM-DD)
5. **score:** The IMDb user rating
6. **votes:** The number of user votes
7. **director:** The person who directed the movie
8. **writer:** The person who wrote the movie
9. **star:** The main actor/actress in the movie
10. **country:** The country where the movie was produced
11. **budget:** The budget of the movie. If a movie has no budget, it appears as 0.
12. **gross:** The revenue of the movie
13. **company:** The production company that made the movie
14. **runtime:** The duration of the movie

<p align = "justify"> 
It is worth noting that the data in this dataset is publicly available, so there may be limitations to its accuracy or completeness. Additionally, as with any dataset, it's important to carefully review and clean the data before using it for analysis to ensure its quality and reliability.</p>
